## Getting Started

For an introduction to using markdown for notes, see the [Getting Started Guide](../statistics/getting_started.md).

## How to Use These Notes

1. Start with the fundamentals in [Computer Architecture Fundamentals](computer_architecture_fundamentals.md) if you're new to computer architecture
2. Each topic builds on previous concepts, so it's recommended to follow the order of the table of contents
3. Use the links to navigate directly to specific topics of interest
4. Refer to the original lecture notes for more detailed explanations
5. For quick reference to all mathematical formulas, see the [Equations](equations.md) page
