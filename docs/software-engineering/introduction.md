## Core Principles of Software Engineering

### 1. Abstraction

<div title="Abstraction focuses on essential aspects while hiding unnecessary details">
Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling at different levels of detail. It helps manage complexity by focusing on relevant aspects while hiding implementation details.
</div>

**Examples of Abstraction Levels:**
- **Conceptual**: Entity-relationship diagrams, class diagrams
- **Specification**: Interfaces, APIs, contracts
- **Implementation**: Actual code, algorithms, data structures

### 2. Modularity and Separation of Concerns

<div title="Modularity breaks complex systems into manageable, loosely coupled components">
Modularity involves dividing a system into discrete, manageable components with clear responsibilities and minimal dependencies.
</div>

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Complex System] --> B[Module 1]
    A --> C[Module 2]
    A --> D[Module 3]
    
    B --> E[Submodule 1.1]
    B --> F[Submodule 1.2]
    C --> G[Submodule 2.1]
    D --> H[Submodule 3.1]
    D --> I[Submodule 3.2]
    
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style I fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Benefits of Modularity:**
- Improved maintainability
- Parallel development
- Reusable components
- Localized impact of changes
- Easier testing

### 3. Encapsulation and Information Hiding

<div title="Encapsulation restricts access to implementation details to prevent dependencies">
Encapsulation bundles data and operations while hiding internal states and implementation details. It creates a protective barrier around components.
</div>

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Account {
        -accountNumber: String
        -balance: double
        -owner: Customer
        +getBalance(): double
        +deposit(amount: double): void
        +withdraw(amount: double): boolean
    }
    
    note for Account "Internal implementation details\nare hidden behind public interface"
```

### 4. Software Process Models

<div title="Process models provide structured approaches for software development">
Software process models define structured approaches to developing software, specifying activities, roles, deliverables, and workflows.
</div>

**Common Process Models:**

| Model | Characteristics | Best Suited For | Limitations |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Waterfall** | Sequential phases<br>Each phase completed before next | Well-understood requirements<br>Stable domains | Inflexible to changes<br>Late feedback |
| **Iterative** | Multiple cycles of development<br>Progressive refinement | Complex systems<br>Risk management | Potential rework<br>Management overhead |
| **Incremental** | System developed in increments<br>Partial implementations | Early functionality delivery<br>Prioritized features | Integration challenges<br>Architecture issues |
| **Spiral** | Risk-driven approach<br>Prototyping and evaluation | High-risk projects<br>Complex requirements | Complex<br>Resource-intensive |
| **Agile** | Adaptive planning<br>Evolutionary development | Changing requirements<br>Customer collaboration | Less documentation<br>Scaling challenges |
