| Code Quality | Defect Density | Defects / KLOC (thousands of lines of code) |
| Coverage | Statement Coverage | (Executed statements / Total statements) × 100% |
| Coverage | Branch Coverage | (Executed branches / Total branches) × 100% |
| Performance | Response Time | Time between request and complete response |
| Security | Vulnerability Density | Number of vulnerabilities / KLOC |

## Quality Assurance Activities

### 1. Quality Planning

The process of developing a quality plan that outlines the specific quality practices, resources, and activities relevant to a specific project.

**Key Components of a Quality Plan:**
- Quality objectives
- Roles and responsibilities
- Quality assurance activities
- Tools and techniques
- Standards and guidelines
- Review and audit procedures
- Defect management process

### 2. Quality Control

The process of monitoring specific project results to determine if they comply with relevant quality standards and identifying ways to eliminate causes of unsatisfactory performance.

**Types of Quality Control Activities:**
- **Reviews**: Systematic examination of artifacts by peers
- **Inspections**: Formal evaluation technique where software artifacts are examined to detect defects
- **Walkthroughs**: Informal meetings where developers guide the team through code or documentation
- **Testing**: Execution of software to detect defects

### 3. Process Improvement

The ongoing effort to analyze and improve processes, services, products, and systems to meet or exceed customer expectations.

**Common Process Improvement Models:**
- **CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)**
  - Five maturity levels: Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, Optimizing
- **ISO 9001**
  - International standard for quality management systems
- **Six Sigma**
  - Data-driven approach to eliminate defects and reduce variation
- **PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act)**
  - Iterative four-step management method for continuous improvement

## Software Testing

### Testing Levels

| Level | Focus | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Unit Testing | Individual components or functions | Testing a single method or class |
| Integration Testing | Interactions between integrated components | Testing API calls between modules |
| System Testing | Complete, integrated system | End-to-end testing of entire application |
| Acceptance Testing | User requirements and business processes | User acceptance testing (UAT) |

### Testing Approaches

#### Black Box Testing
- Tests the functionality without looking at the internal code structure
- Focuses on inputs and expected outputs
- Types: Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, decision table testing, state transition testing

#### White Box Testing
- Tests the internal structure or workings of an application
- Requires programming knowledge
- Types: Statement coverage, branch coverage, path coverage

#### Gray Box Testing
- Combines elements of both black box and white box testing
- Limited knowledge of internal workings
- Examples: Matrix testing, regression testing, pattern testing

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

An iterative development process where tests are written before the code:

1. Write a failing test that defines expected functionality
2. Write minimal code to pass the test
3. Refactor the code while ensuring tests still pass

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Write Test] --> B[Test Fails]
    B --> C[Write Code]
    C --> D[Test Passes]
    D --> E[Refactor]
    E --> A
```

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

An extension of TDD that focuses on describing behavior in a natural language format:

```gherkin
Feature: User login
  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
```

## Verification and Validation

### Verification
Ensuring the product is built correctly (conformance to specifications)

**Questions addressed:**
- Are we building the product right?
- Does the software conform to its specifications?

**Techniques:**
- Reviews
- Inspections
- Walkthroughs
- Static analysis

### Validation
Ensuring the right product is built (fitness for purpose)

**Questions addressed:**
- Are we building the right product?
- Does the software meet user needs and expectations?

**Techniques:**
- Functional testing
- User acceptance testing
- Beta testing
- Usability testing

## Static Analysis

The examination of code without executing it, to find potential defects, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

### Static Analysis Techniques

| Technique | Description | Tools |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Linting | Identifying programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors | ESLint, Pylint, RuboCop |
| Code smell detection | Identifying poor design choices | SonarQube, PMD |

## Test Automation

### Test Automation Pyramid

```
    /\
   /  \
  /    \
 / UI   \
/--------\
/ Service \
/----------\
/   Unit    \
/------------\
```

- **Unit Tests**: Fast, stable, focused tests at the method/class level
- **Service/API Tests**: Testing integration points and APIs
- **UI Tests**: End-to-end tests through the user interface

### Test Automation Frameworks

## Summary

Effective Software Quality Assurance is essential for delivering reliable, maintainable, and secure software. Key principles include:

- Quality must be built in, not tested in
- Early detection of defects saves time and resources
- Automation is crucial for consistent quality verification
- Both process and product quality matter
- Continuous improvement driven by metrics and feedback
- Balance between quality and other constraints (time, cost)

By implementing comprehensive QA practices throughout the software development lifecycle, organizations can significantly reduce defects, improve user satisfaction, and reduce the total cost of ownership.
