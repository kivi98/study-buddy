## What is Requirements Engineering?

Requirements Engineering (RE) is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system. It involves systematic handling of requirements through an iterative process of eliciting, analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing requirements.

## Why Requirements Engineering Matters

- **Foundation for Development**: Requirements serve as the foundation for all subsequent development activities
- **Cost of Errors**: Fixing requirements errors becomes exponentially more expensive in later stages
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensures the system meets stakeholder expectations
- **Scope Management**: Helps control project scope and prevent feature creep
- **Quality Assurance**: Provides a baseline for validation and verification

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe what the system should do - the services, tasks, and functions the system must perform.

**Examples**:
- The system shall allow users to register with email and password
- The system shall send email notifications when an order is placed
- The system shall validate credit card information before processing payment

### Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify criteria for judging the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors.

#### Categories of Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Performance** | Speed, response time, throughput | The system shall respond to user queries within 2 seconds |
| **Reliability** | Availability, fault tolerance, recovery | The system shall be available 99.9% of the time |
| **Usability** | User interface, accessibility | The system shall be accessible to visually impaired users |
| **Security** | Authentication, authorization, data integrity | The system shall encrypt all stored passwords |
| **Maintainability** | Ease of modification, extensibility | The system shall follow a modular architecture |
| **Scalability** | Ability to handle growth | The system shall support up to 10,000 concurrent users |
| **Compatibility** | Integration with other systems | The system shall be compatible with major web browsers |
| **Regulatory** | Compliance with laws and standards | The system shall comply with GDPR requirements |

### User Requirements

User requirements express the needs and constraints of the system from the user's perspective, often in natural language or using simple diagrams.

**Example**:
"As a customer, I want to be able to track my order so that I know when to expect delivery."

### System Requirements

System requirements provide detailed technical descriptions of what the system must do to satisfy user requirements.

**Example**:
"The order tracking subsystem shall update order status every 15 minutes and notify customers via their preferred communication channel when status changes."

## Requirements Engineering Process

### 1. Requirements Elicitation

Requirements elicitation is the process of gathering requirements from stakeholders and other sources.

#### Elicitation Techniques

| Technique | Description | Best Used When |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Interviews** | One-on-one discussions with stakeholders | Detailed information is needed from key stakeholders |
| **Questionnaires** | Structured sets of questions | Large number of stakeholders are geographically dispersed |
| **Workshops** | Collaborative sessions with multiple stakeholders | Consensus among stakeholders is needed |
| **Observation** | Watching users perform tasks | Current processes need to be understood |
| **Prototyping** | Creating system models for feedback | Requirements are unclear or feedback is needed |
| **Document Analysis** | Examining existing documentation | Replacing or enhancing existing systems |
| **Use Cases** | Describing interactions between users and system | Understanding system functionality from user perspective |
| **User Stories** | Short descriptions of features from user perspective | Agile development approaches are used |

#### Stakeholder Analysis

            Primary users
            Secondary users
            Indirect users
        Clients
            Project sponsors
            Financial decision-makers
        Development Team
            Analysts
            Designers
            Developers
            Testers
        External Entities
            Regulatory bodies
            Integration partners
            Competitors
```

#### Challenges in Requirements Elicitation

- **Domain Knowledge Gap**: Understanding specialized industry terminology and processes
- **Communication Barriers**: Different stakeholders have different vocabularies
- **Tacit Knowledge**: Stakeholders may have difficulty articulating implicit knowledge
- **Conflicting Requirements**: Different stakeholders may have contradicting needs
- **Scope Creep**: Continuously expanding requirements

### 2. Requirements Analysis

Requirements analysis involves examining, understanding, and refining raw requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, consistent, and feasible.

#### Analysis Techniques

- **Requirements Classification**: Categorizing requirements by type, priority, etc.
- **Requirements Modeling**: Creating models to visualize requirements
- **Requirements Prioritization**: Determining importance of requirements
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolving contradictions between requirements
- **Feasibility Analysis**: Determining if requirements can be implemented

#### Requirements Prioritization Methods

| Method | Description | Strengths | Limitations |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **MoSCoW** | Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have | Simple, easy to understand | Subjective, lacks fine granularity |
| **Numerical Assignment** | Assigning priority values (1-5, etc.) | Quantitative, scalable | May lead to too many "high priority" items |
| **100-Point Method** | Distributing 100 points among requirements | Forces trade-offs | Time-consuming for many requirements |
| **Kano Model** | Basic, Performance, Excitement attributes | Links to customer satisfaction | Complex to implement |
| **Relative Weighting** | Pairwise comparison of requirements | Systematic, reduces bias | Time-intensive for large requirement sets |

#### Requirements Dependencies

    A[Requirement A] -->|Requires| B[Requirement B]
    C[Requirement C] -->|Conflicts with| D[Requirement D]
    E[Requirement E] -->|Enhances| F[Requirement F]
    G[Requirement G] -->|Alternative to| H[Requirement H]
```

### 3. Requirements Specification

Requirements specification involves documenting the requirements in a clear, precise, and verifiable manner.

#### Specification Formats

- **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**: Comprehensive document describing all system requirements
- **User Stories**: Brief descriptions of functionality from a user perspective
- **Use Cases**: Detailed descriptions of system interactions
- **Feature Lists**: Enumeration of system capabilities
- **Formal Specifications**: Mathematical or structured language descriptions

#### Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

A well-structured SRS typically includes:

1. **Introduction**
   - Purpose and scope
   - Definitions and acronyms
   - References
   - Overview

2. **Overall Description**
   - Product perspective
   - Product functions
   - User characteristics
   - Constraints and assumptions

3. **Specific Requirements**
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements
   - Interface requirements
   - Performance requirements
   - Design constraints

4. **Appendices**
   - Data models
   - Analysis models
   - Supporting information

#### User Story Format

```
As a [role]
I want [capability]
So that [benefit/value]
```

**Example**:
```
As a mobile banking user
I want to receive real-time notifications for transactions
So that I can immediately detect unauthorized activities
```

#### Use Case Specification

```
Use Case: Process Payment
Primary Actor: Customer
Precondition: Customer has items in shopping cart
Main Success Scenario:
1. Customer selects checkout option
2. System displays order summary
3. Customer provides payment information
4. System validates payment information
5. System processes payment
6. System displays confirmation
Postcondition: Order is placed, payment is processed
Alternate Flows:
- If payment validation fails, system displays error message
```

### 4. Requirements Validation

Requirements validation ensures that the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs and that they are complete, consistent, and feasible.

#### Validation Techniques

| Technique | Description | Benefits |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Requirements Reviews** | Systematic examination of requirements by stakeholders | Finds defects early, ensures stakeholder alignment |
| **Prototyping** | Creating mockups or working models | Provides concrete visualization, early feedback |
| **Acceptance Tests** | Defining tests that requirements must pass | Ensures requirements are testable |
| **Simulation** | Modeling system behavior | Tests complex scenarios, interactions |
| **Walkthroughs** | Step-by-step review of requirements | Educational, thorough examination |
| **Traceability Analysis** | Ensuring all requirements are traceable | Identifies gaps, redundancies |

#### Quality Criteria for Requirements

1. **Correct**: Accurately represents stakeholder needs
2. **Unambiguous**: Has only one interpretation
3. **Complete**: No missing information
4. **Consistent**: No contradictions with other requirements
5. **Verifiable**: Can be tested or validated
6. **Traceable**: Source can be identified
7. **Feasible**: Can be implemented within constraints
8. **Prioritized**: Importance is indicated
9. **Necessary**: Adds value to the system
10. **Concise**: Expressed without unnecessary information

### 5. Requirements Management

Requirements management involves controlling changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

#### Requirements Traceability

Requirements traceability links requirements to their sources, to other requirements, and to system artifacts.

```mermaid
