## Network Communication Modes

### Half Duplex vs Full Duplex

#### Half Duplex

**What it is:** A communication mode where data can travel in both directions, but only one direction at a time.

**How it works:**
- Devices take turns transmitting
- When one device is sending, the other can only receive
- Requires a mechanism to control which device can transmit

**Characteristics:**
- Simpler hardware requirements
- Less efficient use of bandwidth
- Higher latency due to turn-taking

**Real-world examples:**
- Walkie-talkies
- Traditional Ethernet hubs
- CB radios

**Diagram:**
```
Device A ──────────────> Device B
         <──────────────
         (at different times)
```

#### Full Duplex

**What it is:** A communication mode where data can travel in both directions simultaneously.

**How it works:**
- Both devices can transmit and receive at the same time
- Uses separate channels or frequencies for each direction
- No need to coordinate turns

**Characteristics:**
- More efficient use of bandwidth
- Lower latency
- More complex hardware requirements

**Real-world examples:**
- Modern Ethernet switches
- Telephone conversations
- Fiber optic links

**Diagram:**
```
Device A ──────────────> Device B
         <──────────────
         (simultaneously)
```

### Comparison of Communication Modes

| Feature | Half Duplex | Full Duplex | Simplex |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Direction | Bidirectional (one at a time) | Bidirectional (simultaneous) | Unidirectional |
| Bandwidth Utilization | 50% (theoretical max) | 100% | 100% in one direction only |
| Latency | Higher | Lower | Lowest |
| Example | Walkie-talkie | Telephone | Television broadcast |
| Collision Possibility | Yes | No | No |
| Hardware Complexity | Medium | Higher | Lowest |
| Protocol Complexity | Higher (needs media access control) | Lower | Lowest |
