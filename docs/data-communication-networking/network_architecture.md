## Reference Models

### OSI Reference Model

**What it is:** The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.

**Purpose:**
- Provides a standard framework for network communication
- Enables interoperability between diverse communication systems
- Facilitates modular engineering
- Simplifies teaching and understanding of network operations

**The Seven Layers:**

| Layer | Name | Function | Examples |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| 7 | **Application** | Provides network services directly to end-users | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS |

**Data Flow in OSI Model:**

```
   Host A                                           Host B

                        Router
```

**Encapsulation/Decapsulation:**
- Each layer adds its own header (and sometimes trailer) to the data
- Lower layers see the entire package from higher layers as data
- Process reverses at the receiving end

**Advantages of OSI Model:**
- Reduces complexity by separating network functions into layers
- Standardizes interfaces between network components
- Facilitates modular engineering
- Ensures interoperability between vendors
- Simplifies troubleshooting by isolating network problems to specific layers

**Limitations of OSI Model:**
- Some layers (especially session and presentation) have overlapping functions
- Not widely implemented exactly as specified
- Developed before widespread internet use, so some aspects are less relevant
- Can be considered too theoretical and complex

### TCP/IP Model

**What it is:** A four-layer conceptual model that describes the communication functions of the Internet protocol suite.

**History:** Developed by DARPA in the 1970s, preceding the OSI model. Based on practical implementation of the Internet.

**The Four Layers:**

| TCP/IP Layer | Corresponding OSI Layers | Protocols/Examples |
|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Application** | Application, Presentation, Session | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, Telnet |
| **Transport** | Transport | TCP, UDP, SCTP |
| **Internet** | Network | IP, ICMP, IGMP, ARP |
| **Network Access** | Data Link, Physical | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP, MPLS |

**Layer functions in detail:**

1. **Network Access Layer:**
   - Combines functionality of OSI physical and data link layers
   - Specifies how data is physically sent through the network
   - Handles hardware addressing (MAC addresses)
   - Describes the protocols for the physical transmission of data
   - Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP, Frame Relay

2. **Internet Layer:**
   - Corresponds to OSI network layer
   - Handles packet routing and logical addressing (IP addresses)
   - Responsible for delivering packets across multiple networks

   - Combines functionality of OSI application, presentation, and session layers
   - Provides protocols for application-level processes
   - Handles data representation, encoding, and dialog control
   - Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SSH, DNS, SNMP

**Comparison with OSI Model:**

```
   OSI Model                TCP/IP Model
┌───────────────┐        ┌───────────────┐
│  Application  │        │               │

└───────────────┘        └───────────────┘
```

**Advantages of TCP/IP Model:**
- Pragmatic and implementation-oriented
- Widely implemented and used globally
- Proven scalability (forms the basis of the Internet)
- Simpler structure with fewer layers
- Protocols were developed before the model, ensuring practical functionality

**Limitations of TCP/IP Model:**
- Less detailed than OSI model
- Network access layer encompasses too many functions
- Not as useful as OSI model for describing non-TCP/IP networks
- Less emphasis on general network concepts and more on specific protocols

### Comparison of OSI and TCP/IP Models

| Feature | OSI Model | TCP/IP Model |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Number of layers** | Seven | Four |
| **Development approach** | Theoretical, then protocols | Protocols first, then model |
| **Protocol independence** | General, can describe any network | Specific to TCP/IP protocol suite |
| **Communication** | Layer-to-layer approach | End-to-end approach |
| **Adoption** | Valuable for understanding networks | Basis for all internet communications |
| **Layer structure** | Distinct separation of functions | Some overlap in application layer |
| **Ease of implementation** | Complex to implement | Easier to implement |
| **Troubleshooting use** | Excellent reference for isolating issues | Practical but less detailed framework |

## Network Switching Technologies

### Packet-Switched Networks

**What it is:** A communication method where data is broken into small packets, which are transmitted independently through the network and reassembled at the destination.

**How it works:**
1. Data is divided into packets with headers containing routing information
2. Each packet can take a different route through the network
3. Network devices (routers) make forwarding decisions for each packet individually
4. Packets are reassembled at the destination

**Key characteristics:**
- Efficient utilization of network resources
- Dynamic routing capabilities
- No dedicated path between sender and receiver
- May experience variable delay (jitter)

#### Datagram Packet Switching

**What it is:** A connectionless packet-switching approach where each packet is treated independently.

**How it works:**
1. Each packet (datagram) contains complete addressing information
2. No pre-established path or resource reservation
3. Each router makes independent forwarding decisions for each packet
4. No guarantee of packet delivery order or reliability

**Real-world applications:**
- Internet Protocol (IP)
- UDP-based applications
- DNS queries
- Streaming media

**Diagram:**
```
                                  ┌─────┐
                             ┌───►│Router│───┐
                             │    └─────┘   │
┌────────┐    ┌─────┐    ┌─────┐         ┌─────┐    ┌────────┐
│  Source│───►│Router│───►│Router│        │Router│───►│Destination│
└────────┘    └─────┘    └─────┘         └─────┘    └────────┘
                             │    ┌─────┐   │
                             └───►│Router│───┘
                                  └─────┘
                      Packets may take different paths
```

#### Virtual Circuit Packet Switching

**What it is:** A connection-oriented packet-switching approach that establishes a predetermined path before data transmission begins.

**How it works:**
1. A setup phase establishes a virtual circuit with reserved resources
2. All packets follow the same path through the network
3. Packets need only contain a virtual circuit identifier, not full addressing
4. The circuit is terminated when the communication is complete

**Phases:**
1. **Circuit Setup:** Path is determined and resources are reserved
2. **Data Transfer:** Packets are forwarded along the established path
3. **Circuit Termination:** Resources are released when communication ends

**Real-world applications:**
- Frame Relay
- ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
- MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
- Some VPN implementations

**Diagram:**
```
┌────────┐    ┌─────┐    ┌─────┐    ┌─────┐    ┌────────┐
│  Source│───►│Router│───►│Router│───►│Router│───►│Destination│
└────────┘    └─────┘    └─────┘    └─────┘    └────────┘
            Virtual circuit: pre-established path
```

### Circuit Switching Networks

**What it is:** A communication method that establishes a dedicated physical path between sender and receiver for the duration of the communication session.

**How it works:**
1. A dedicated circuit is established before communication begins
2. Resources are reserved along the entire path
3. The circuit provides guaranteed bandwidth and consistent performance
4. The circuit is maintained for the entire duration, even during periods of silence

**Key characteristics:**
- Guaranteed bandwidth
- Consistent performance (fixed delay)
- Inefficient for bursty traffic
- Setup time required before communication can begin

**Real-world applications:**
- Traditional telephone systems (PSTN)
- ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network)
- Circuit-switched cellular voice (2G GSM)
- Some dedicated leased line services

**Diagram:**
```
┌────────┐                                       ┌────────┐
│Caller A │                                       │Caller B │
└────┬───┘                                       └────┬───┘
     │                                                │
┌────┴───┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌────────┴─┐
│Switch 1│────│Switch 2 │────│Switch 3 │────│Switch 4  │
└────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └──────────┘
    Dedicated physical path for the entire call duration
```

|---------|------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Connection Setup | Required | Required | Not required |
| Dedicated Path | Yes | Logical path, not dedicated | No |
| Bandwidth | Fixed | Can vary | Can vary |
| Congestion | None within circuit | Possible | Possible |
| Overhead | Low after setup | Medium | High (full addressing) |
| Failure Recovery | Poor (entire circuit fails) | Medium | Good (packets reroute) |
| Billing | Based on time and distance | Based on usage | Based on usage |
| Example | Traditional phone call | ATM, MPLS | Internet Protocol (IP) |

## Transmission Media

Transmission media are the physical pathways that connect devices in a network. They are categorized into two main types: guided (wired) and unguided (wireless).

### Guided Transmission Media

### Electromagnetic Spectrum

**What it is:** The range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.

**How it works:**
- Electromagnetic waves are characterized by their frequency and wavelength
- Different frequency ranges are suitable for different communication applications
- Lower frequencies travel farther but carry less data
- Higher frequencies carry more data but travel shorter distances and are more easily blocked

**Diagram:**
```
Low Frequency ◄───────────────────────────────────────────────────► High Frequency
Long Wavelength                                                    Short Wavelength

|―――――――|―――――――|―――――――|―――――――|―――――――|―――――――|―――――――|―――――――|―――――――|
  Radio   Micro-  Infrared Visible  Ultra-   X-rays  Gamma
  waves   waves           light    violet           rays
                                    
  AM/FM   Wi-Fi   Remote  Fiber    
  TV      Cell    control optic
          phones  
```

**The politics of the electromagnetic spectrum:**
- Spectrum is a limited natural resource
- Regulated by government agencies (e.g., FCC in the US, ITU internationally)
- Allocated through licensing or auctions
- Different regions may have different allocation schemes
- Unlicensed bands (e.g., ISM bands used for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) allow innovation without licensing
- Spectrum reallocation occurs as technologies evolve (e.g., digital TV transition)
