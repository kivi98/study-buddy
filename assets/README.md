# Assets Directory

This directory is for storing images, diagrams, and other media files used in your markdown documents.

## Usage

When referencing assets in your markdown files, use relative paths:

```markdown
![Image Description](../assets/image-name.png)
```

## Recommended File Organization

- Use descriptive filenames for your assets
- Consider organizing files in subdirectories by topic or document
- For version control efficiency, optimize images before adding them

## Supported File Types

Common file types that work well with markdown:

- Images: PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG
- Documents: PDF
- Other: CSV, JSON (for data references)

## Example

The following is a reference to a sample image that would be stored in this directory:

`![Sample Diagram](../assets/sample-diagram.png)`

*Note: You would need to add actual image files to this directory for the references to work.*
