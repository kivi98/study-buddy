{a)

Assume that two nodes with different communication speeds and finite buffers need
to communicate over a noiseless channel efficiently and reliably. Identify possible

issues that can occur in the above scenario and suggest suitable techniques that can

be used to address those issues. You may use diagrams where necessary.

the final routing table of node A of the following network diagram. All the
intermediate steps need to be shown clearly.

“(b)

An ISPis given a public IP range to serve its clients in
1 the mosteffectivemannerss=—=——=—————

______ TheISP.has divided -its-clients-intothret Tain
ma groupss namely AA, B, and C where
Clientsjin each subnetwork of the above groups can facilitate 2000, 1000, and 200
computers accessing the network respectively. Group A consumes half of the ISPs

original address space and Group B, and C equally consume the rest. Further, the

address space of each main group is again divided into three subgroups X, Y, and Z,
_ where each ‘can facilitate half (1/2), quarter (1/4), and one eighth (1/8) of its main
groups address space. (eg: if ISPs original address space consists of n number of IP

addresses, Group B, represents n/4 addresses and Subgroup B;Z; represents n/32

addresses; where i, and j are the indexes (zero- based) of groups and subgroups
respectively)
If one of the IPs of ISP is 143.16.23.175, and the address spaces are divided according

to the alphabetical order, answer the following questions. Moreover, you may assume
that the ISP’s subnet mask is /19.

(i) How many subnetworks can be defined under the Group B (B;s)?
(ii) What is the subnet mask of C3 (zero-based indexing) sub network?

(iii) What is the network address (Subgroup)

of the

subnetwork that the

143.16.23.175 IP address is belong to?

(iv) What is the subnet mask of the above (iii) subnetwork?
(v)

What is the last usable IP address of the above (iii) subnetwork?
